#HW0 Prime Numbers
###First Name - Last Name
TraviCI Badge here

##Problem statement :
Write a function which finds the n<sup>th</sup> prime number. For simplicity, we assume that the input will always be an integer(int). If the input is smaller than or equal to 0, the function should return -1.

## Files to work on
* `src/PrimeNumber.cpp` Implement the necessary functions therin


###Running tests
* To run the program, select the configuration `main_executable` from the top right and click on run
* To run the tests, select the configuration `runTests` from the top right and click on run
* To use Clion's Google test configuration:
    * Goto Run->Edit Configurations..
    * Select the "+" icon on the top left to add a new configuration of type "Google Test"
    * Enter in a name, and also target configuration as any one of the above
    * Select Ok.
    * You can now use this configuration for better test display by CLion.

##Notes 
* What is a prime number ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
* In our problem, we consider 2 is the first prime number. 
* Check the logs from Travis to verify the correctness of your program.
* The Initial code will **not necessarily** compile. You will have to write the necessary code.
* It is recommended that you add your name and travis ci badge to your readme.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* If you need to be considered for partial grade for any reason(failing tests on travis,etc). Then email the staff before the deadline. Late email requests may not be considered.
* Post questions on Piazza if you have any questions.
* Please contact the course staff if you run into issues. We are here to help you!
* look at this video for how to run CLion tests: https://youtu.be/8Up5eNZ0FLw
